The design of the proposed seasonal self-evolving neural networks for short-term wind farm power prediction is illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:model}. We first classify the historical data into non-ramp, ramp-up, and ramp-down datasets, where the non-ramp dataset is further split into 4 datasets for 4 seasons. Then, we leverage NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) to train neural networks, which evolves the neural networks using a genetic algorithm to find the best weighting parameters and network topology using the classified datasets. Therefore, 12 neural networks (6 for GE and 6 for Mitsubishi) are trained, in order to capture these different power output dynamics of GE and Mitsubishi turbines. Under this design, the model will select appropriate neural networks based on GE and Mitsubishi turbines' recent power outputs to predict short-term wind farm power. The design details of each component  are described in the following.
