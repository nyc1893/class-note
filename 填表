每年一月份左右DDL的奖学金：

My goal is to attain a career where I can use my specialized information technology skills combined with strong business background to help organization implement information technologies to achieve their technology and business goals.
I am very passionate about information technology and how it can be successfully implemented and managed to help organizations become more efficient and effective. 
This scholarship will certainly reduce my financial burden that I come from a poor country with only less than one fifth GDP per capita of United states. And In turn I will try my best to help small business and all the people need when I got my study degree in terms of my professional skill in data mining and computer science skills.
I believe my education and experience fits nicely with the scholarship requirements, and I am certain that this scholarship will make a significant contribution to my continuing education.
